## Description

Welcome to Weekend Movies Saga! This application allows a user to browse a list of movie posters. When a poster is clicked, it allows the user to see details about that specific movie including the poster, what genres that movie is/has, and a description of the movie. When a user clicks the 'Back to Movies' button, they are taken back to the library of movies where they can repeat that process for any movies they wish to learn more about.

## Installation
1. Create a database named "saga_movies_weekend"
2. The queries in the database.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries.
3. Open a code editor of your choice, and run npm install.
4. Run npm run server in your terminal
5. Run npm run client in your terminal, this will open the application in a new browser tab for you.

## Usage

1. Browse the movies and their posters on the main screen. You will notice that hovering on a poster slightly expands the view.
2. Click on the poster for any movie you would like to read more about. This will take you to a details page for that specific movie.
3. Read the details of that movie, including genres, and a description of that movie.
4. Click on the 'Back to Movies' button to go back to the movie gallery.
5. Repeat 1-4 for any other movie you wish to learn more about.
